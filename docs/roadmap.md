| 11 | Teach-and-repeat `navigate_to` / `retrace` | 🔜 Planned — ADR-008 D5 |

> **Lean core (ADR-006).** Runtime layer hot-swap (`Pipeline.swap_layer` /
> `LayerSlot.swap`) and competing-planner fan-in arbitration (`MergeStrategy.ARBITRATE`,
> dynamic `add_impl`/`remove_impl`) were **removed** as speculative machinery with no
> routine consumer. The "swappable models" capability is preserved by the routine
> registry/factory (each routine wires the layer implementations it needs) and by
> multi-source perception fan-in (`FanInSlot`, pass-through). Inter-layer queues now
> carry **typed message instances** rather than dicts. See ADR-006.

> **Vertical slice (current):** A minimal concrete implementation of every layer
> now exists, and `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py` runs the full
> `Perception → World Model → Planning → Action` loop end-to-end against a mock
> device (the Phase 6 "full-pipeline integration test" deliverable, landed
> early). The autonomy loop closes: a near ultrasonic reading drives a stop +
> reverse + steer command sequence. Phases 3–5 below now track the remaining
> *full* implementations.

## Architecture Principle — autonomon is the brain

All input processing and modeling lives in **autonomon**: sensor fusion,
computer vision, person/object detection, world modeling, and planning. The
autonomy pipeline is **self-contained between two boundaries** — Perception
ingests *raw* inputs, Action emits *action* commands — and everything in
between is autonomon's responsibility.

**nomothetic stays a thin hardware gateway.** It serves *raw* inputs (sensor
reads, raw camera frames/stream) and accepts *action* outputs (drive, steer,
stop, camera pan/tilt) over REST. It performs **no** perception, detection, or
modeling; no autonomy logic is ever pushed down into nomothetic or nomopractic.

**Consequences:**
- New capabilities (e.g. person detection) are added as autonomon perception
  implementations that pull raw data from nomothetic, **not** as new processing
  endpoints on nomothetic.
- nomothetic's API surface only grows when a *new raw input or raw actuator*
  is exposed — never to add interpretation of existing data.
- Heavy models can run in the autonomon process wherever it is hosted
  (on-device or on a remote host); the boundary contract is unchanged either
  way.

---

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0 — nomon_explore Plugin (Pre-Framework)

**Deliverables:**
- `nomon_explore` package: standalone obstacle-avoidance drive plugin
- `NomothicClient` wrapping httpx for nomothetic REST calls
- `ExploreConfig` dataclass; `run_loop` control function
- CLI entry point (`nomon-explore`) reading env vars, emitting NDJSON lifecycle events
- `nomon_manifest` dict for plugin discovery by `nomothetic AutonomyPluginManager`
- Capabilities: ultrasonic obstacle detection, grayscale cliff detection
- Parameters: speed, obstacle threshold, cliff threshold, duration, loop interval, avoidance timing

**Architecture note:** Phase 0 embedded all logic in a single-package monolith. That package no longer exists on disk (only empty `nomon_explore/src/` and `tests/` scaffolding remain). Phases 1–5 build the layered framework; Phase 6 (reshaped) re-introduces `explore` as a *routine* — a registry entry that wires the framework — rather than restoring the monolith. See ADR-003.

---

### Phase 1 — Core Framework (`autonomon` package)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Delivered:**
- `autonomon` package with `autonomon.messages`: `PerceptionEvent`, `WorldStateUpdate`, `ActionPlan`, `ActionResult` dataclasses with `to_dict()` / `from_dict()`
- Layer base classes: `PerceptionBase` (`run(queue_out)`), `WorldModelBase` / `PlannerBase` (`run(queue_in, queue_out)`), `ActionBase` (`run(queue_in)`), each with `stop()`
- `autonomon.pipeline.Pipeline`: wires layers with bounded asyncio queues and graceful shutdown
- Per-layer task ownership (`autonomon.slot.LayerSlot`, `SlotState`) and multi-source perception fan-in (`autonomon.fan_in.FanInSlot`, pass-through). (Runtime hot-swap and planner arbitration were later removed — ADR-006.)
- pytest suite covering pipeline wiring, back-pressure, hot-swap, and fan-in
- `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/adr/001-layered-architecture.md`, `docs/adr/002-rest-api-client-pattern.md`

---

### Phase 2 — Perception Implementations

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Delivered:**
- `autonomon.perception.Perceptron`: a single configurable perception class declaring `sensor_type` + `endpoint` + `interpreter`, sharing all polling, timeout, error-handling, and stop logic
- Built-in sensors defined in one declarative `_SENSOR_SPECS` table, exposed via named constructors:
  - `Perceptron.ultrasonic` → `GET /api/sensor/ultrasonic`; emits `data={"distance_cm": float | None}`
  - `Perceptron.grayscale` → `GET /api/sensor/grayscale`; emits `data={"channels": [...], "values": [...]}` — **raw** ADC counts. The raw endpoint (not `/normalized`) is used deliberately: this hardware reads inverted vs the normalisation calibration, so a cliff is a *low* raw reading (floor ~400-900, edge ~30; threshold 200). See the World Model section and `ObstacleWorldModel`.
  - `Perceptron.battery` → `GET /api/hat/battery`; emits `data={"voltage_v": float}`
- Configurable poll interval and per-request timeout per instance (battery defaults to 30 s; others 0.1 s)
- Custom sensors via the general `Perceptron(...)` constructor with a user-supplied interpreter
- Transient HTTP errors, request errors, and timeouts are absorbed; the poll loop continues
- `AsyncMock` / `MagicMock` httpx fixtures for device-free testing (per ADR-002)

**Design note:** the original plan called for one class per sensor (`UltrasonicPerception`, `GrayscalePerception`, `BatteryPerception`); this was consolidated into a single configurable `Perceptron` so sensor differences are data (endpoint + interpreter + interval), not duplicated classes.

---

## Planned Phases

### Phase 3 — Occupancy-Grid World Model

**Status:** ✅ **Complete** — built *with* a concrete consumer (the `patrol`
routine) per ADR-006/ADR-007, rather than as speculative infrastructure.

**Delivered:**
- `autonomon.world_model.OccupancyWorldModel`: a **robot-centric local costmap**
  with configurable **state decay** (cells age out after `decay_s` — the deferred
  decay item). Beyond `ObstacleWorldModel`'s booleans it adds short-term spatial
  memory — `recently_blocked`, `occupied_cells`, `nearest_obstacle_cm`, and a
  serialisable `occupancy` snapshot — while still emitting
  `obstacle_ahead`/`cliff_detected`, so it is a drop-in `WorldModelBase`. Emission
  is debounced on the salient booleans so grid churn never floods the planner.
- `ObstacleWorldModel` remains for `explore` (the minimal boolean slice).

**Scope note (deferred stretch).** With the fleet's single forward ultrasonic and
no odometry, cells are placed on the forward axis only — a decaying range-profile,
not a world-frame map. A **world-frame grid on an odometry/encoder source** (and
off-axis cell placement from a sweeping sensor) is the remaining stretch, deferred
until a routine needs true spatial mapping; the model upgrades to it without an
interface change (ADR-007).

---

### Phase 4 — Rule-Based Planner (rule-table / TOML)

**Status:** ✅ **Complete** — built *with* a concrete consumer (`patrol`, plus an
`explore` rule-table variant) per ADR-006/ADR-007.

**Delivered:**
- `autonomon.planning.RulePlanner`: evaluates world state against an ordered rule
  table (first match wins), loadable from TOML via `RulePlanner.from_toml`.
  Conditions support `lt`/`le`/`gt`/`ge`/`ne`/`eq`/`in`/`truthy`/`exists`
  operators and `any_of` OR-groups; a per-rule `hold_s` generalises
  `AvoidancePlanner.avoid_duration_s`. It reuses `AvoidancePlanner`'s idle-tick
  loop, so runtime behaviour is identical — only the rule set is data.
- Bundled tables `planning/rules/explore.toml` (reproduces `explore`'s
  avoid/cruise, proven equivalent by test) and `planning/rules/patrol.toml`.
- `AvoidancePlanner` remains `explore`'s default planner (no regression); the rule
  engine is opt-in via `build_explore(params={"planner": "rule"})` and the basis
  of `patrol`.

---

### Phase 5 — Vehicle Action Executor

**Goal:** Execute `ActionPlan` sequences against the nomothetic REST API.

**Done (minimal slice):**
- `autonomon.action.VehicleAction`: executes `ActionPlan.actions` in priority order
- Maps `drive`/`steer`/`stop` to `POST /api/drive`, `/api/steer`, `/api/hat/motor/stop`
- Injected httpx async client (device JWT per ADR-002); emits `ActionResult` per
  action with success/error; best-effort telemetry seam via an optional results queue
- Absorbs transient HTTP/timeout errors without stopping the layer

**Done (full version):**
- Configurable retry with exponential backoff on transient errors (timeout /
  connection / 5xx); a 4xx is not retried; a 2xx with an unparseable body is not retried
- Safety-stop: if a `drive`/`steer` still fails to reach the device after retries, a
  best-effort `POST /api/hat/motor/stop` is issued before recording the failed result

---

### Phase 6 — Routine Registry (`explore` as first entry)

**Reshaped from "Migrate nomon_explore to Layered Framework."** The `nomon_explore`
monolith no longer exists on disk, so there is nothing to migrate. Instead of
restoring a standalone package, we generalise into a **routine registry**: each
routine is a named factory that wires a `Pipeline` from layer configs, and
`explore` becomes one registry entry. The integration test's `_build_pipeline()`
helper is already the `explore` factory in embryo. See ADR-003 for the decision
and the "Routines" section of `architecture.md` for the design.

> **Naming note:** an `autonomon` *routine* (host-side cognitive pipeline in a
> plugin process) is deliberately **distinct** from nomothetic's HAT-level
> `start_routine` IPC method / `POST /api/routine/start` (firmware obstacle
> avoidance inside nomopractic). They share the word and the example name
> `explore` but are different execution models. Docs say "autonomy routine" vs
> "HAT routine" to keep them apart.

**Goal:** Introduce a routine registry and the single generic plugin that runs
any routine by name; ship `explore` as the first entry — pure wiring of existing
Phase 2–5 layers.

**Deliverables:**
- `autonomon.routines` module: a registry mapping routine name → factory, plus
  the built-in `explore` factory wiring `Perceptron.ultrasonic` (+ optional
  `Perceptron.grayscale` via `FanInSlot`), `ObstacleWorldModel`,
  `AvoidancePlanner`, and `VehicleAction`
- `explore` factory accepts `(client, device_id, params)`; params map to layer
  constructor args (`obstacle_threshold_cm`, `forward_speed_pct`,
  `turn_angle_deg`, `cliff_threshold`)
- A single plugin CLI entry point (e.g. `nomon-autonomon`) that reads the routine
  name from `NOMON_PLUGIN_PARAMS`, looks it up in the registry, builds the
  `Pipeline`, runs it, and emits the existing NDJSON lifecycle events
- `nomon_manifest` listing available routine names and the union of their param
  schemas, discoverable by `nomothetic AutonomyPluginManager` as one manifest
- `tests/test_pipeline_integration.py` updated to build `explore` via the
  registry rather than its private `_build_pipeline()` helper
- ✅ Full-pipeline integration test against a mock device already landed
  (`tests/test_pipeline_integration.py`, Phase 3–5 vertical slice)
- The empty `nomon_explore/` scaffolding directory is removed

---

### Phase 6b — `follow-user` Routine

**Goal:** Add a second routine that proves the registry generalises beyond
wiring — it requires net-new layer implementations.

**Reuses unchanged:** `VehicleAction` (the action layer is target-agnostic).

**Net-new (the cost of a pursuit behaviour):**
- A **vision perception implementation** — a new perception layer that polls
  *raw* camera frames from nomothetic and runs person detection **inside
  autonomon**, emitting target bearing/range. Per the brain principle above, the
  detector is an *autonomon* dependency — nomothetic only serves the raw frame.
  Stack: **ONNX Runtime + a YOLOv8n model** (person class), behind a swappable
  `Detector` abstraction so CI injects a fake detector and the model can be
  replaced. Runtime deps: `onnxruntime`, `numpy`, `pillow` (a `[vision]` extra);
  `ultralytics` (AGPL) is used only offline to export the ONNX model, never at
  runtime.
- A **target world model** — a new `WorldModelBase` impl tracking the target's
  relative position over time (EMA smoothing, lost-target timeout), not a boolean
  obstacle flag
- A **pursuit planner** — a new `PlannerBase` impl that closes distance to a
  moving target (steer toward bearing, hold a `target_distance_cm` standoff),
  rather than avoiding obstacles
- `follow-user` factory + registry entry; params: `target_distance_cm`,
  `max_speed_pct`, `confidence_threshold`, `camera_hfov_deg`,
  `lost_target_timeout_s`, `model_path`

**Camera frame source.** `POST /api/camera/capture` writes a JPEG to disk and
returns metadata only — it does **not** return frame bytes. The only existing
frame-bytes path is the MJPEG stream. So this phase adds one small raw-input
endpoint to nomothetic: **`GET /api/camera/frame`** → `image/jpeg`, reusing the
camera's existing in-memory JPEG capture. This is ADR-004-legal (a *raw input*,
no interpretation) — it is the single exception to "no new nomothetic endpoint",
chosen over multipart-MJPEG parsing because it fits the perception poll model
exactly. The autonomon process may run on-device or on a remote host; the
boundary contract is unchanged.

---

### Phase 6c — Device Deployment & Integration Testing

**Goal:** Enable autonomous capability deployment to devices and add CI checks
for end-to-end autonomy testing.

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Plugin auth handshake (nomothetic ADR-019): Ed25519 challenge-response so the
  plugin obtains a device JWT without any token on disk. `autonomon.plugin_auth`
  (keygen, signing, `PluginTokenAuth` with refresh-on-401, deploy CLI) +
  nomothetic `plugin_auth` / `plugin_auth_routes` (`register` localhost-only,
  `challenge`, `token`). The CLI prefers `NOMON_PLUGIN_KEY` over a static
  `NOMON_PLUGIN_TOKEN`.
- ✅ `scripts/deploy.sh` — deploy from latest semver tag or `--local` source tree
  via rsync; installs autonomon into its **own** venv (separate from nomothetic per
  ADR-005); optional test run;
  verifies CLI + manifest; **generates the on-device key, writes the plugin env
  file (no token), and registers the public key over loopback**; reloads
  `nomothetic-api.service` if running; rollback on failure. Same interface
  pattern as nomothetic/nomopractic workspace scripts.
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `check` job (ruff + black + mypy + pytest with
  coverage) on push/PR to main; `release` job creates a GitHub Release on `v*` tags.
- ✅ Device integration test (`tests/test_integration_subprocess.py`): spins up a mock
  nomothetic over loopback, runs the `nomon-autonomon` CLI as a subprocess for both
  `explore` and `follow-user` (fake-detector hook), and asserts sensor/frame reads →
  drive/steer/stop commands reach the mock. Subprocess-level, CI-suitable.
- ✅ `README.md` deployment guide: dev setup, running a routine, the vision model fetch,
  and `scripts/deploy.sh` / `make deploy` usage.

**Rationale:** Phase 6 is complete but exists only in the repo; Phase 6b/7 will
add more routines. Without automated deployment and CI, we cannot verify that
the autonomy stack works end-to-end on actual hardware, and regressions can
silently break the pipeline. Deployment scripts let developers/QA test quickly;
CI ensures the contract holds across the fleet.

---

### Phase 6d — `follow-user` Camera Tracking, Search & Distance-Keeping

**Goal:** Make `follow-user` actively track the person with the camera, search
when nobody is visible, and hold a configurable standoff (default ≈ 2 ft).

**Reuses unchanged:** the four-layer `Pipeline` runtime; `VisionPerception` and
`TargetWorldModel` are extended in place, not replaced.

**Delivered:**
- ✅ **Camera centring** — `VisionPerception` now also emits a vertical bearing
  (`target_vertical_bearing_deg`, from the box `cy` and a new `camera_vfov_deg`);
  `TargetWorldModel` smooths and tracks it alongside the horizontal bearing.
- ✅ **`FollowPlanner`** (`planning/follow.py`, supersedes `PursuitPlanner` for this
  routine) — proportional pan/tilt to re-centre the person; **coupled** body
  steering toward the *body-relative* bearing (camera pan offset + in-frame
  bearing) so the camera self-recentres toward forward as the body turns in;
  distance-proportional drive with a deadband (drive-while-turning); and a
  time-driven **search** state machine — camera pan/tilt sweep, then a body-pivot
  arc once a sweep is exhausted, resuming until the target is reacquired.
- ✅ **`VehicleAction`** gained `pan`/`tilt` → `POST /api/camera/pan|tilt`
  (camera-only; a failed camera command does not trigger a motor safety stop).
- ✅ New `follow-user` params: `camera_vfov_deg`, `pan_gain`/`tilt_gain`,
  `pan_min_deg`/`pan_max_deg`, `tilt_min_deg`/`tilt_max_deg`, `search_step_deg`,
  `search_interval_s`, `search_tilt_offset_deg`, `body_rotate_speed_pct`,
  `body_rotate_duration_s`; `target_distance_cm` default lowered 80 → 60 cm.

**Boundary note:** no new nomothetic endpoints — `POST /api/camera/pan` and
`/api/camera/tilt` already existed as raw actuator commands (ADR-004-legal). This
is a pure brain-side change.

---

### Phase 7 — Autonomy Telemetry to ArcadeDB

**Status:** ✅ **Complete.** The open question — the **device→central transport
and auth** — was settled the same way nomothetic Phase 25 settled device
telemetry: **MQTT is the device→central transport**, so no new
device-authenticated central REST ingestion endpoint is introduced (which would
have re-opened the deferred device→central auth design). autonomon itself is
unchanged: its `StatusReporter` already reports `starting`/`running`/`stopping`/
`error` lifecycle events (with `run_id` + `device_id`) to the device's routine
status sink. nomothetic forwards those recorded events to central, which persists
them.

**Design (as built):**
- **autonomon:** no change. The existing `StatusReporter.report()` seam
  (`cli.py`) is the run/event source. Per-action `ActionResult` telemetry was
  deliberately **not** forwarded — explore loops every ~100 ms, so that would
  flood the topic for little fleet-dashboard value; the `VehicleAction`
  results-queue seam remains available if a consumer ever needs it.
- **nomothetic (device, Phase 27):** `autonomy_forwarder.AutonomyEventForwarder`
  mirrors every event recorded by the `RoutineLogStore` (via a new `on_event`
  observer hook) onto the MQTT autonomy topic (`nomon/autonomy`,
  `NOMON_MQTT_AUTONOMY_TOPIC`). Best-effort, bounded queue, reconnect back-off —
  no broker means autonomy history simply stays device-local.
- **nomothetic (central, Phase 27):** the existing `TelemetryConsumer` also
  subscribes to the autonomy topic and persists runs/events via
  `autonomy_store.{InMemory,Sql}AutonomyStore`. Served by
  `GET /api/fleet/devices/{vin}/autonomy` and
  `GET /api/fleet/devices/{vin}/autonomy/{run_id}/events` (central JWT,
  ownership-scoped).
- **nomographic:** central migration `V4__add_autonomy_schema.sql` —
  `AutonomyRun` + `AutonomyEvent` vertices, `PerformedBy` (run→Vehicle) and
  `PartOf` (event→run) edges.

---

## Planned Phases (ADR-008 — navigation strategy)

> Direction set by ADR-008 (2026-09-13): composable skills over a shared world
> state, selected by a priority arbiter; ROS-shaped internal contracts, no ROS.
> See `REVIEW-2026-09-13.md` (workspace root) for the review that motivated it.

### Phase 8 — Odometry & IMU Raw Inputs → `PoseEstimator`

**Goal:** Give the brain a pose. Everything downstream (subsumption-safe
following, retrace, any future navigation) depends on knowing where the robot
is and which way it faces.

**Cross-repo dependency:** nomopractic Phase 16 (encoder + IMU drivers,
`read_odometry` / `read_imu` IPC) and nomothetic Phase 30
(`GET /api/sensor/odometry`, `GET /api/sensor/imu` raw endpoints).

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `Perceptron.odometry` → `GET /api/sensor/odometry`; emits
      `{"left_ticks", "right_ticks", "dt_s"}` (or per-wheel distance) at 20 Hz
- [ ] `Perceptron.imu` → `GET /api/sensor/imu`; emits gyro/accel (and heading
      when the IMU fuses it) at 20 Hz
- [ ] `world_model/pose.py` — `PoseEstimator`: dead-reckoning integration of
      encoder distance + gyro yaw (complementary filter); publishes
      `pose` (x, y, θ in the odom frame) and `twist` (v, ω)
- [ ] Messages: `WorldStateUpdate.state["pose"]` / `["twist"]` documented in
      `architecture.md`
- [ ] Tests: straight-line, in-place turn, and arc integration against a
      synthetic encoder/gyro trace; drift bound documented

**Exit criteria:** on the PicarX, a 2 m out-and-back drive reports return
position within 10 % of distance travelled; `make check` clean.

---

### Phase 9 — Shared World State + Skill Arbiter (safe following)

**Goal:** One always-running pipeline. Safety behaviours subsume task
behaviours so following can never drive into an obstacle or off an edge.
Closes the highest-priority safety gap from the 2026-09-13 review.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `world_model/state.py` — `WorldState` (pose, twist, `obstacle_ahead`,
      `cliff_detected`, occupancy snapshot, target track, battery, timestamps)
      and a single `WorldModel` that hosts *estimators* (the existing obstacle,
      occupancy, and target models refactored to update fields of the shared
      state)
- [ ] `planning/skills/` — `Skill` protocol (`evaluate(state, now) -> Motion |
      None`), `Motion` (v, ω, pan, tilt, priority); built-in skills `estop`,
      `cliff_stop`, `avoid`, `follow_operator`, `hold`, `wander`, `idle`
- [ ] `planning/arbiter.py` — `SkillArbiter(PlannerBase)`: fixed priority
      order, per-skill `hold_s` commit windows, emits an `ActionPlan` only on
      change (keeps today's debounce and idle-tick loop)
- [ ] `action/vehicle.py` gains a `cmd_vel` method (`v_mps`, `omega_radps`,
      `ttl_ms`) beside `drive`/`steer`; kinematics move to nomopractic (ADR-008
      D3). Until nomopractic ships `cmd_vel`, a shim converts (v, ω) → PicarX
      speed/steer in the action layer
- [ ] Routines become skill sets: `explore` = `{wander}`, `follow-user` =
      `{follow_operator}`, `patrol` = `{wander}` + occupancy caution rule.
      Registry, manifest, and catalogue file unchanged (ADR-005)
- [ ] Delete `planning/pursuit.py` (superseded, no consumer)
- [ ] Tests: arbitration order (cliff beats avoid beats follow), hold windows,
      subprocess integration for all three routines through the arbiter

**Exit criteria:** `follow-user` on the PicarX stops for a box placed between
it and the operator and backs off a table edge; all existing routine tests
pass through the new arbiter; `make check` clean.

---

### Phase 10 — UWB Following (`UwbPerception`)

**Goal:** Make following robust and fast enough for a cart by ranging to a
worn tag instead of steering on a 0.8 Hz detector.

**Cross-repo dependency:** nomopractic Phase 16.3 (UWB module UART driver,
`read_uwb`), nomothetic Phase 30 (`GET /api/sensor/uwb`).

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `Perceptron.uwb` → `GET /api/sensor/uwb`; emits `{"range_cm",
      "bearing_deg" | null, "quality"}` at ≥10 Hz
- [ ] `TargetEstimator` prefers UWB range/bearing; vision refines bearing and
      confirms identity; search uses the last UWB bearing
- [ ] `follow_operator` tuned on UWB (standoff, deadband, loss timeout)
- [ ] Tests with a synthetic tag trace (approach, lateral move, dropout)

**Exit criteria:** following holds a 60 cm standoff while the operator walks a
figure-eight outdoors at dusk, with the camera covered.

---

### Phase 11 — Teach-and-Repeat `navigate_to` / `retrace`

**Goal:** "Point-to-point on command" for the hauling loop without a map or
GPS: retrace a taught route with visual drift correction (QVPR-style
teach-and-repeat, monocular + odometry).

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `world_model/trail.py` — records odometry poses plus low-resolution
      camera keyframes every `keyframe_m` metres while any skill drives
- [ ] `retrace` skill — replays the trail in reverse: pure-pursuit on trail
      poses, lateral/heading correction from keyframe correlation matching;
      `avoid`/`cliff_stop` remain active above it
- [ ] `navigate_to(place)` — named places are saved trail endpoints; the
      skill selects the trail and direction
- [ ] Tests: synthetic trail replay with injected odometry drift corrected by
      keyframe matches

**Exit criteria:** after being followed 30 m outdoors, "return" brings the
robot within 1 m of the start with no operator input.

**Deferred beyond Phase 11 (needs a job that requires it):** metric map and
global planner (Nav2 or equivalent); navigation foundation models as an
alternative `navigate_to` implementation; ArduPilot Rover as the cart's
low-level autopilot (decided with the drivetrain, ADR-008 D3).
